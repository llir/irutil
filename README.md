LLVM IR utility functions.

The `irutil` repository provides utility functions for LLVM IR and is intended to supplement `llir/llvm`.

## Experimental

**Note:** the API of `irutil` is to be considered experimental. We intend to iterate on the design of the API, so make sure to pin versions to ensure stability.
